# Transcription
# Welcome to the end of the introduction to shiny. You've come a very long way 
# you learned how to do many impressive things with the shiny r package. Most 
# notably, you could create interactive web apps to share your analysis as a data
# product, with clients colleagues, customers bosses, you name it. Now you've 
# learned to do quite a bit and the best way to solidify your knowledge. You've
# got a tamed here is to practice, practice, building, your own, shiny apps. But
# as you do this, Might become curious about more advanced shiny topics. Believe
# It or Not, There are some we're adding new features to the shiny package all 
# the time or you might have questions that haven't been answered in this course.
# So before we leave, I want to show you where you could keep abreast of the most
# recent developments in shiny and where you can learn more things about shiny.
# I also want to show you where you can get help with shiny related questions.
# Both of these things are websites. The first website that I want to draw your
# attention to is shiny.rstudio.com. Gog.com. We've mentioned this website several
# times in the class and it is the shiny Development Center. If you go to the 
# shiny.rstudio.com you'll see the web page looks like this there's some 
# introductory explanation about what shiny is but the most important sections 
# of the web page right here at the top in the gallery, you'll find some very 
# simple shiny apps that each do very specific things. You could click on any 
# of the shiny apps to open the app in a window in a very special way. Here you 
# have the app. This is the k-means clustering app. We looked at earlier in the 
# course but beneath the app is they actual code used to make the app? And 
# moreover the code is designed. So part of it will turn yellow when you interact
# with the app. In other words, these are the recipes that shinies running each 
# time, you make a change. This format can help you see how shiny Works in each 
# of these examples and then you could learn from the examples, learning, by 
# example, the next part of the shiny webpage, that you might be interested in, 
# is the tutorial section. We have two tutorials about shiny that cover 
# introductory topics to be honest. They don't go as far in depth as this tutorial
# , I know, because I made both of the other ones, but they are a good way to go 
# back and learn things at a slower. Pace, one of them's a video tutorial, 
# like we're doing today but the other ones are in tutorial which means it really 
# is Your pace, it goes as fast as you want to read it. And just like this 
# tutorial, it has some exercises and model answers for you to try out. Next, 
# there's a reference section which is just the reference that you'd find in The
# Help Pages for the shiny package, but displayed in a more readable format. And
# then finally, there is an article section. We have over 50 articles that 
# described in depth, different parts of the shiny package. This is a treasure
# Trove of information about shiny and this is where you can learn more advanced
# things about shiny. For example, we have three articles here, that cover, how
# to use, interactive plots and shiny. We also have articles dedicated to things
# like using a And buttons or using sliders or the shiny layout guide or using 
# tab sets. There's so much information here. If you want to be deep in your 
# expertise and shiny come to the article section of shiny.rstudio.com. Now, 
# what if you have a question about shiny, where should you go for help? You 
# can certainly go to websites, like stack, Overflow or people are answering 
# questions about shiny that stackoverflow.com, but there is one website that 
# I want to show you. In particular, it's the Google group for Shiny users, 
# this is the web link for the, for the Google group. It's 
# groups, dot google.com, slash Forum / hashtag exclamation mark Forum /, shiny - discuss,
# or you could just Google shiny, discuss Google group and you'll find this Inside
# the Google group, you can search the questions. I've been asked by people who
# use shiny and you can read the answers that the people of had, the questions are
# searchable. So there's a good chance that if you have a question, it's already
# in here in the form database and you can immediately read the answer that worked
# in the past. If you have a new question, you could post it to the Google group 
# and shiny users will help you out. The best part about this Google group is that
# the maintainers of shiny read it. So I'm not going to guarantee you that Zhou. 
# Chang the author shinies, go respond to your question if you post it here. Here.
# But he very well might and if you have suggestions for how to improve shiny,
# Winston Joe you a the people are working on shiny are likely to see them if you
# post them here, and who knows? We might even incorporate your suggestions into 
# the our package. So those are the two most useful websites that you will find 
# as you continue your journey with shiny. Thank you very much for taking my 
# course, and I hope that you found it. Helpful in learning, how to use the shiny
# package.
